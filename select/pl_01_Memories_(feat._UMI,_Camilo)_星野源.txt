Woke up in the middle of the day
Wonder if I slept too late
Got me thinking 'bout
what I'm supposed to say today?
Living in the past with
no time to waste, yeah
Memories,
keep playing in my head like
Enemies, showing in my face
Like, save me, please
I just wanna live right now
I tried to hold on
to the way that I am
But I'm changing
I'm changing, yeah
I tried to be myself again
But I'm changing
And changing, yeah
Taking a breath
to slow down time
Though it's a mess
sometimes inside
Trying my best to live a life
That's worth something, honestly
We're all alone, I feel somehow
So we sing a song
to cross our paths
Sharing some time
to live our lives
That's worth something, oh
Tengo miedo de lo rápido
Que va la historia
Los besos que nos dimos
Serán memoria
Yo quería todo lento
La trayectoria
Y está todo borroso
Como en euforia
Y dicen que el
presente es un regalo
Pero no dicen pa'
quien ni de parte de quién
Y mi presente ya es pasado
Y yo no pude frenar pa'
saborearlo bien
揺れる穂の 笑み記憶
変わり続ける
祈り遠き 愛しさも
君も消えるよ
Taking a breath
to slow down time
(Slow down time)
Though it's a mess
sometimes inside
Trying my best to live a life
That's worth something, honestly
We're all alone,
I feel somehow (Ooh)
So we sing a song
to cross our paths
Sharing some time
to live our lives
That's worth something, oh
Taking a breath to
slow down time (Taking a breath)
Though it's a mess
sometimes inside
Trying my best to live a life
That's worth something, honestly
We're all alone, I feel somehow
So we sing a song
to cross our paths
Sharing some time
to live our lives
That's worth something, oh
